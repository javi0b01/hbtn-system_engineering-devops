## Background Context
You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), without the help of Google:
###### General
* Why is monitoring needed
* What are the 2 main area of monitoring
* What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
* What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)

## Requirements
###### General
* ```Shellcheck```

## Tasks
* [x] 0. Sign up for Datadog and install datadog-agent
* [x] 1. Monitor some metrics
* [x] 2. Create a dashboard
